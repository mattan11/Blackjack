# Blackjack

### This is standard Blackjack game made in OOP JavaScript

## Requirements

* `node` : `^12 || >=14`
* `npm`

# Setup

## Installation

Install all dependencies using `npm` *clean install* command.

```sh 
$ npm ci
```

> More on the clean install npm command can be read here [`npm ci`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/ci.html)

> You can still use `npm install` in cases the `npm ci` raises system error due to specific platform incompatibilities.

## Define Package Metadata

* Amend `package.json` file and optionally specify:
    * `name` - Name of your project. A name can be optionally prefixed by a scope, e.g. `@myorg/mypackage`.
    * `version` - Specify and maintain a version number indicator for your project code.
    * `author` - Your organisation or just yourself. You can also
      specify [`contributors`](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#people-fields-author-contributors).
    * `description` - Short description of your project.
    * `keywords` - Put keywords in it. It’s an array of strings.
    * `repository` - Specify the place where your code lives.
    * `license` - Announce your code license, figure out the license
      from [Choose an Open Source License](https://choosealicense.com) .
    * `browserslist` - Specify the supported browsers versions - you can refer
      to [full list](https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist#full-list) of availalbe options.

# Configuration

## Environment Configuration

* Edit the [`configuration/environment.js`](configuration/environment.js) if you want to specify:
    * **`server`**: configure development server, specify `host`, `port`. Refer to the full development server
      configuration options for [`webpack-dev-server`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/).
    * **`limits`**: configure file size thresholds for assets optimizations.
        * Image/Font files size in bytes. Below this value the image file will be served as Data URL (_inline base64_).
    * **`paths`**: `src` or `dist` directories names and file system location.

## Additional `webpack` configuration

You can additionally configure `webpack` for specific environment:

* `development` - [`configuration/webpack.dev.config.js`](configuration/webpack.dev.config.js)
* `production` - [`configuration/webpack.prod.config.js`](configuration/webpack.prod.config.js)
    * Note that if you prefer to build and
      deploy [`sourcemap`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/devtool/#production) files:

> You should configure your server to disallow access to the Source Map file for normal users!

# Development

## Assets Source

* **SASS/PostCSS** files are located under `src/scss/`
* **JavaScript** files with support of latest ECMAScript _ES6 / ECMAScript 2016(ES7)/ etc_ files are located
  under `src/js/`
* **Image** files are located under `src/images/`
* **Font** files are located under `src/fonts/`
* **HTML** files are located under `src/`
    * It will **automatically** build **all HTML files** placed under `src/` directory, no need to manually configure
      each template anymore!

## Build Assets

### One time build assets for development

```sh
$ npm run build
```

### Build assets and enable source files watcher

```sh
$ npm run watch
```

This command is suitable if you develop with external web server.

> **Note:** File watching does not work with *NFS* (*Windows*) and virtual machines under *VirtualBox*. Extend the
> configuration in such cases by:

```js
module.exports = {
  //...
  watchOptions: {
    poll: 1000 // Check for changes every second
  }
};
```

### Start a development server - reloading automatically after each file change.

```sh
$ npm run dev
```

# Production

## Build Assets

Optimize assets for production by:

```sh
$ npm run production
```

## Get Built Assets

* _CSS_ files are located under `/dist/css/`
* _JavaScript_ files with support of _ES6 / ECMAScript 2016(ES7)_ files are located under `/dist/js/`
* _Images_ are located under `/dist/images/`
    * Images part of the _design_ (_usually referenced in the CSS_) are located under `/dist/images/design/`
    * Images part of the _content_ (_usually referenced via `<img>` tags_) are located under `/dist/images/content/`
* _Fonts_ are located under `/dist/fonts/`
* _HTML_ files are located under `/dist/`

# Run Code Style Linters

## SASS

```sh
$ npm run lint:sass
```

## JavaScript

```sh
$ npm run lint:js
```

# Additional Tools

## Run Assets Bundle Analyzer

```sh
$ npm run stats
```

> This will open the visualisaion on the default configuraiton URL `localhost:8888`, you can change this URL or port
> following the [package](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/webpack-bundle-analyzer#options-for-cli) documentation.

## Continuous Integration

This boilerplate template contains integration with [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/). The build system runs all
linting scripts and deploys production optimized pages to _GitHub_ pages upon push to the `master` branch. However, note
that this deployment flow only works for _Project Pages_, as User and Organization
pages [only support the master branch flow](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/).

For more information on how to set up alternative deployment processes, check out
the [Travis CI documentation on deployment](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment). The service can deploy to
dozens of cloud providers, including Heroku, AWS, and Firebase.
